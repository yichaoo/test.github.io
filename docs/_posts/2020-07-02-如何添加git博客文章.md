Navigate to the publishing source for your site. For more information about publishing sources, see "About GitHub Pages."

Navigate to the _posts directory.

Create a new file called YYYY-MM-DD-NAME-OF-POST.md, replacing YYYY-MM-DD with the date of your post and NAME-OF-POST with the name of your post.

Add the following YAML frontmatter to the top of the file, replacing POST TITLE with the post's title, YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss -0000 with the date and time for the post, and CATEGORY-1 and CATEGORY-2 with as many categories you want for your post.
